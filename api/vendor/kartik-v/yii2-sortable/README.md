yii2-sortable
=================

A Yii 2.0 widget that allows you to create sortable lists and grids and manipulate them using simple drag and drop. 
It is based on the lightweight [html5sortable](http://farhadi.ir/projects/html5sortable) jQuery plugin, which uses native HTML5 API for drag and drop. 
It is a leaner alternative for the JUI Sortable plugin and offers very similar functionality. The **yii2-sortable widget** offers these features:

- Less than 1KB of javascript used (minified and gzipped).
- Built using native HTML5 drag and drop API.
- Supports both list and grid style layouts.
- Similar API and behaviour to jquery-ui sortable plugin.
- Works in IE 5.5+, Firefox 3.5+, Chrome 3+, Safari 3+ and, Opera 12+.
